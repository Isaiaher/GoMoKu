<h1>GoMoKu Distribution</h1>

This folder contains the server and client side applications for the GoMoKu game. Make sure if you donwload them that they stay in the folders so their libraries are accesable. The server is a little glitchy on macs and may need restarting a few times. The client and server are also currently set up for just local play, but you can easily change those by looking in the constants class in the client side and rebuilding the application.
